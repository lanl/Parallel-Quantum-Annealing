# Parallel Quantum Annealing

The Arxiv version of the paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05995)

The classical exact solver we used to compare to D-Wave Advantage 1.1 was the fast maximum clique (fmc) solver. This solver can be downloaded [here](http://cucis.ece.northwestern.edu/projects/MAXCLIQUE/download.html)

```generate_disjoint_clique_embeddings.py``` generates all-to-all connectivity minor embeddings for different quantum annealing hardware connectivities.

```create_random_QUBOs.py``` generates test random graphs and their corresponding Maximum Clique QUBOs.

```fmc_utils.py``` are utility functions for using fmc.

```get_exact_solutions.py``` computes all maximum cliques using brute force classical clique enumeration methods in Networkx.

```run_QA.py``` Calls D-Wave in order to solve the set of test problems using both sequential and parallel QA.

```run_fmc.py``` Solves the test problems exactly using fmc, and records the time this computation used.

`hardware_edges/` contains reference connectivites for three different D-Wave QA backends.
